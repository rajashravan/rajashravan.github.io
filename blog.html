								<h3>February 3rd - 5th, 2017</h3>


<p>

This week, I had three assignments due and I had three midterms to study for. Realizing how much I had so much to do and so little time, I did what any responsible student would do – I took a bus to Queen’s and spent the weekend programming, meeting new people, and eating free food (notice I left sleeping off that list). I finished the weekend with one finished project, a better knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery, six free meals, a couple of new friends, and about 3 hours of sleep.
</p>
<p>
I applied for this hackathon back in January. I was hesitant at first because I didn’t think I knew enough to attend one of these before. To me, hackathons were only for elite programmers. Luckily, my friend Alban was also going and convinced me to sign up.
</p>
<p>
The start of the hackathon was a little messy. I found a team of two first year engineering students from uWaterloo and one business student who had a love of data science. A few of the project themes this year revolved around mental health, so we decided to make a virtual therapist chatbot Android app, that also allowed the user to wear a virtual reality headset to see calming visuals and hear relaxing music.
</p>
<p>
We were psyched to make something so cool and then we realized something – none of us knew how to make mobile applications. Damn. Still, we were headstrong and convinced that this was a winning idea and spent the next 12 hours mulling over how we could either A) learn how to use Android Studio, learn Java and churn out a functioning app in 20 hours or B) use some other tool that would allow us to produce a prototype that we could present. Half of us were convinced we could do it, the other half not as much. We mulled over it and an hour later... we still had nothing. I decided that at this rate we were going to have nothing to present at the expo so I went off the rails a little and started researching how to make chrome extensions while my group continued to debate about what to do. I told them I would work on this little project as a back-up. I had come up with a cool idea and thought that it would be quick to make.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to midday Saturday. I had eaten one too many bagels and had barely enough sleep to function properly, but I knew that we didn’t have enough time to make this app or come up with a new project. I already make progress with my little project and kept chugging on. By 10AM Sunday morning, my baby was ready to be handed in for judging. Blok.it was done.
</p>
<p>
Judging was a bit of a rough ride. My app was a little wonky at times and one of the judges from Movember that was supposed to come see our project completely skipped us. Reactions for Blok.it ranged from meh… to OMG this is amazing!
</p>
<p>
1PM. Awards ceremony. Sponsors came up and delivered their prizes to the teams that had come up with amazing projects to the sponsor’s challenges. Flipp, Movember, RLSolutions, all had cool challenges that these students conquered. I had already accepted that Blok.it was unlikely to win anything. So you can imagine my surprise when the MLH judge came up the podium and uttered the words, “Block dot I T”. I was in a moment of genuine disbelief. “Huh?” I look to my left and see Alban smiling at me. I look to the right and see my team members get up. “No way this is happening”. I awkwardly walked through the maze of seats and feet and walk up to the stage with my team to accept our award. “No way this is happening…”
</p>
<p>
This weekend not only instilled in me a love of hackathons, but also gave me the self-confidence I needed to start my own side projects. I even stayed up the following night to overhaul my website and give it a fresh modern look and get a proper .com domain (no more.co.nf for me). I even decided to start writing this blog!
